    "## 1. Eratosthenes’ Shadow Method (3rd Century BCE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea (in simple terms)**\n",
    "Eratosthenes noticed that on the summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead in Syene (no shadow at noon), but in Alexandria (roughly 800 km north), the Sun’s rays had a slight angle and caused a shadow.\n",
    "\n",

    "If $\\Delta \\theta$ is the measured angle between the Sun’s rays at the two locations, and $D$ is the distance between them, then Earth’s *circumference* $C$ is,\n",
    "$$ C = \\frac{360^\\circ}{\\Delta \\theta} \\times D $$\n",

    "---\n",
    "## 1. Ancient Greek & Medieval Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**\n",
    "- Early astronomers, like Aristarchus (3rd century BCE) and Ptolemy (2nd century CE), tried to estimate the Sun–Earth distance using geometry and observations of the Moon’s phases or eclipses.\n",
    "- Their methods relied on angles and ratios between the Moon and the Sun as seen from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approximate Results**\n",
    "- Aristarchus suggested the Sun was around 18–20 times farther away than the Moon (the real factor is about 400).\n",
    "- Later refinements in medieval times still had large uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy**\n",
    "- In modern terms, these ancient results could be off by factors of 5 to 10 (or more).\n",
    "- Still, they established the concept that the Sun was very far away—much farther than the Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. 17th Century: Early Parallax Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**\n",
    "- With the rise of telescopes in the early 1600s, astronomers used $parallax$ (the shift in a planet’s apparent position when viewed from different points on Earth) to estimate distances.\n",
    "- Giovanni Cassini (late 17th century) measured the $parallax$ of Mars and used geometry to infer 1 AU (the Earth–Sun distance).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Angular shift} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Baseline}}{\\text{Distance}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "By carefully measuring how much Mars “moved” against distant stars from different observing stations, Cassini could calculate the Earth–Sun distance indirectly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 18th Century: Transits of Venus\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**\n",
    "- Edmond Halley realized that observing Venus crossing the Sun’s disk (a $transit$) from different locations would let astronomers measure the Sun–Earth distance more accurately.\n",
    "- Multiple worldwide expeditions (1761 and 1769) measured Venus’s exact contact times with the Sun’s edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy**\n",
    "- By the late 18th century, the 1 AU value was pinned down to within about 2–3%.\n",
    "- Challenges included timing errors and weather, but it was still a remarkable leap forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. 19th & Early 20th Century Refinements\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**\n",
    "- Astronomers used better telescopes, improved star catalogs, and photographic plates to measure $parallax$ more precisely (e.g., of asteroids like Eros).\n",
    "- Advanced math (orbital mechanics, least-squares) refined the 1 AU measurement further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy**\n",
    "- By the early 20th century, estimates got within 1% of the modern value.\n",
    "- Systematic errors dropped as instruments became more accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Mid-20th Century to Now: Radar & Spacecraft\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Idea**\n",
    "- In the 1960s, scientists bounced radar signals off planets (especially Venus). By timing the signals’ round-trip, they obtained a direct measure of distance.\n",
    "- Spacecraft tracking (radio signals) then pinpointed the Earth–Sun distance with even greater precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Accuracy**\n",
    "- Modern values fix 1 AU at about 149,597,870.7 km.\n",

    "## Q4) Find the accuracy of parallax measurement of Hipparcus and GAIA by looking into the papers by the groups. Is it a single number or a distribution? what does the distribution look like?\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Hipparcos vs. Gaia: Do They Have a Single Accuracy Number or a Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about the accuracy of parallax measurements (the “distance” measurements to stars) from missions like **Hipparcos** and **Gaia**, there is **no single number** that applies to all stars. Instead, the uncertainties follow **distributions** that depend on brightness, crowding of the field, color of the star, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hipparcos\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Original Hipparcos Catalog (ESA 1997)**\n",
    "- Typical parallax uncertainty for bright stars: about $1$ milliarcsecond (mas).\n",
    "- Fainter stars or tricky cases can have larger uncertainties, sometimes a few mas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **New Reduction (van Leeuwen 2007)**\n",
    "- Refined data processing reduced some systematic errors.\n",
    "- Typical uncertainties around $0.6$–$1.0$ mas for brighter stars.\n",
    "- Still varies depending on each star’s observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What The Uncertainty Distribution Looks Like**\n",
    "- The errors roughly form a **Gaussian-like “bell curve”** centered on the true value.\n",
    "- There are “tails” for stars that were harder to measure or had fewer/poorer observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Gaia\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Gaia DR2 (2018)**\n",
    "- Bright stars around $G = 15$: typical uncertainty of about $0.03$–$0.04$ mas.\n",
    "- Fainter stars ($G = 20$): can be around $0.7$ mas or more.\n",
    "- Notable “zero-point offset” of roughly $0.03$ mas, meaning all measured parallaxes were systematically shifted by that small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Gaia EDR3 / DR3**\n",
    "- Bright stars ($G = 10$–12): as low as $0.02$ mas.\n",
    "- Fainter stars ($G > 18$–20): can go up to $0.1$–$0.3$ mas or worse.\n",
    "- Still some small systematic offsets (about $0.02$ mas), but much improved over DR2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Shape of the Distribution**\n",
    "- Uncertainties get larger as stars get fainter (higher $G$ magnitude).\n",
    "- Overall, errors typically form a **narrow, near-Gaussian peak**, but again there are wings or tails for special cases (crowded fields, bright/dim limits, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Single “Accuracy” Figure:**  \n",
    "   Each star has its own uncertainty based on how well it was observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distribution of Errors:**  \n",
    "   Parallax uncertainties look roughly Gaussian for most stars, with tails of outliers.  \n",
    "   - Hipparcos: $ \\sim 0.6$–$1$ mas for best cases, up to a few mas otherwise.  \n",
    "   - Gaia: $ \\sim 0.02$–$0.04$ mas for the brightest, going up to $0.3$–$0.7$ mas for faint stars (depending on data release).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Systematic Offsets:**  \n",
    "   Gaia data also comes with a “zero-point” offset that must be accounted for in high-precision work.\n",
