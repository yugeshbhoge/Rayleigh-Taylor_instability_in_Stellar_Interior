# Rayleigh-Taylor_instability_in_Stellar_Interior
This project deals with a general MHD dispersion relation for the Rayleighâ€“Taylor instability in stellar interiors, it also predicts critical / fastest-growing wavelengths, and confirmed the theory with self-written 2-D finite-volume simulations of magnetised flows.
